# Simplified Data Encryption Standard Implementation in C++
S-DES is a simplified version of the DES algorithm. This implementation allows users to choose between encryption and decryption modes, input an 8-bit plaintext or ciphertext, and specify a 10-bit encryption key. Leveraging the power of permutation, exclusive OR operations, and S-box substitution, S-DES encrypts or decrypts data with ease. 

Ideal for a hands-on understanding of symmetric key encryption, and understanding the full-scale DES algorithm.
